/**
 * @file perf/zerocopy.h
 * @ingroup perf
 * @brief Fixed-size zero-copy buffer pool backed by (attempted) contiguous
 *        2 MiB huge page mappings for reduced TLB pressure.
 *
 * The pool allocates a contiguous memory region sized for `buf_count * buf_size`
 * bytes and rounded up to a 2 MiB multiple. It first attempts to obtain 2 MiB
 * huge pages (`MAP_HUGETLB`) and transparently falls back to standard pages if
 * that fails. The region is then subdivided into @c buf_count equally sized,
 * naturally aligned buffers which are pushed into an internal single-producer /
 * single-consumer ring of free pointers (see @ref perf/ringbuf.h).
 *
 * Characteristics / constraints:
 *  - All buffers are fixed-size; partial allocation is not supported.
 *  - Allocation (`perf_zcpool_acquire`) is non-blocking: returns NULL and sets
 *    `errno = EAGAIN` if no free buffers remain.
 *  - Release validates that the pointer lies exactly on a buffer boundary;
 *    invalid pointers are silently ignored (defensive robustness).
 *  - Thread model: underlying free queue is SPSC; multiple producers /
 *    consumers require external synchronization around acquire / release.
 *  - Intended for high-throughput network framing / serialization where
 *    buffers are filled then handed off without copying.
 *
 * Error codes (mapped via utils/errors.h where present):
 *  - EINVAL / ZCP_EINVAL: invalid arguments (size 0, size > 2 MiB, count < 1).
 *  - ZCP_EMMAP: mapping failure (both huge and normal page attempts failed).
 *  - ZCP_EAGAIN: transient exhaustion (no free buffers on acquire).
 *
 * Lifecycle / ownership:
 *  - Create with ::perf_zcpool_create(); destroy with ::perf_zcpool_destroy().
 *  - After destroy the handle pointer is nulled; outstanding acquired buffers
 *    become invalid (must not be used nor released).

/**
 * @file hugeinfo.h
 * @ingroup sysinfo
 * @brief Helper routines for enumerating and sampling Linux huge page state.
 *
 * The sysinfo collector performs a lightweight snapshot of huge page
 * provisioning so that consumers can reason about large page availability and
 * tune memory allocation strategies. The helpers here isolate direct sysfs
 * traversal from higher-level aggregation logic.
 *
 * Data sources:
 *  - `/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-*kB/` directories for each supported
 *    huge page size. Filenames read: `nr_hugepages`, `free_hugepages`,
 *    `nr_overcommit_hugepages`, `surplus_hugepages`, `resv_hugepages`.
 *
 * Functions:
 *  - `list_hugepage_sizes()`: Enumerates discovered huge page size directory
 *    names, parsing the numeric size in KiB. Best-effortâ€”returns as many as
 *    fit in the provided array.
 *  - `get_hugepage_info()`: Populates a ::po_hugepage_info_t for a specific
 *    size. All reads must succeed or the call fails; partial data is not
 *    committed.
 *
 * Concurrency: Reentrant; no global state mutated. Each read opens and closes
 * a file descriptor immediately.
 *
 * Error handling:
 *  - Both functions return 0 on success, -1 on failure. `errno` is set to the
 *    first failing syscall / parsing issue (e.g., ENOENT if sysfs entries are
 *    absent on kernels without huge page support).
 *
 * Ownership: Callers provide storage; no heap memory ownership is transferred.
 *
 * Stability: Internal helper API not guaranteed stable across releases.

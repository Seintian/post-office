/** \file state_store.h
 *  \ingroup director
 *  \brief Storage & query layer backing the Director's authoritative entity
 *         and global state (indexes, iteration utilities, snapshot export).
 *
 *  Design
 *  ------
 *  - Backed by hash tables / arrays keyed by entity id for O(1) lookups.
 *  - Provides stable iteration order (insertion or ID order) for UI tables.
 *  - Supports point-in-time snapshot creation (copy-on-write or epoch based
 *    schemeâ€”TBD) to allow readers to traverse without blocking mutations.
 *
 *  Concurrency Model
 *  -----------------
 *  Single-writer (Director thread). Readers (exporters / UI adapters) obtain
 *  a snapshot handle enabling lock-free iteration. Snapshots are reference
 *  counted (or epoch retired) to defer reclamation.
 *
 *  Error Handling
 *  --------------
 *  - Allocation failures propagate errno=ENOMEM. Insert rejects duplicates
 *    (errno=EEXIST). Snapshot creation may fail under memory pressure.
 *
 *  Observability
 *  -------------
 *  Maintains counters for entity counts by state and churn rates feeding
 *  metrics_export.h.
 *
 *  Future Features
 *  ---------------
 *  - Secondary indexes (by role, priority) for fast filtered scans.
 *  - Incremental diff generation for UI patch updates.
 *
 *  @see state_model.h for state semantics.

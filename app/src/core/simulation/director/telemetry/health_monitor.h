/** \file health_monitor.h
 *  \ingroup director
 *  \brief Aggregates liveness & health signals (CPU load, backlog depth,
 *         failed transitions, queue saturation) into coarse indicators for
 *         UI display and potential adaptive control decisions.
 *
 *  Signals
 *  -------
 *  - Scheduler latency (tick duration distribution).
 *  - Task queue occupancy %.
 *  - Error / warning event rate (from event_log_sink.h).
 *  - Resource exhaustion counters (allocation failures, drops).
 *
 *  Computation Model
 *  -----------------
 *  Updated periodically (every N ticks) to amortize cost; maintains rolling
 *  windows (EWMA / ring buffer). Consumers read pre-digested summaries.
 *
 *  Concurrency
 *  -----------
 *  Updated on Director thread. Readers access last published snapshot with
 *  atomic pointer swap (acquire for readers, release on publish).
 *
 *  Error Handling
 *  --------------
 *  Initialization failure (ENOMEM) aborts monitor; rest of system continues
 *  (health reporting degrades gracefully).
 *
 *  Future
 *  ------
 *  - Anomaly detection (Z-score deviations) for proactive alerts.
 *  - Export Prometheus-style textual endpoint.
 *
 *  @see metrics_export.h

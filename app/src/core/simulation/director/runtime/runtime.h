/** \file runtime.h
 *  \ingroup director
 *  \brief Aggregates global simulation runtime state (configuration knobs,
 *         epoch counters, feature flags) for read-mostly fast access by
 *         Director subsystems.
 *
 *  Scope
 *  -----
 *  - Immutable configuration loaded at process start (parsed from INI / CLI).
 *  - Mutable counters (ticks executed, tasks processed) updated with relaxed
 *    atomics where cross-thread visibility is needed.
 *  - Feature toggles enabling/disabling experimental scheduling strategies.
 *
 *  Access Pattern
 *  --------------
 *  Hot-path readers (scheduler tick, IPC handlers) require minimal overhead;
 *  hence runtime aggregates are stored in a single cache-friendly struct with
 *  related fields co-located. Writes are infrequent (reconfiguration events).
 *
 *  Thread Safety
 *  -------------
 *  - Immutable fields: plain loads (publish-before-main-loop guarantee).
 *  - Counters: atomic fetch-add / relaxed store sufficient (observational).
 *  - Flags: atomic loads with acquire if gating behavior; writes with release.
 *
 *  Error Handling
 *  --------------
 *  Initialization returns -1 with errno on parse/validation failure; the
 *  Director aborts startup in that case.
 *
 *  Future Enhancements
 *  -------------------
 *  - Live reconfiguration via control bridge.
 *  - Snapshot / diff export for diagnostics screen.
 *  - Versioned schema for persistence across restarts.

/** \file scheduler.h
 *  \ingroup director
 *  \brief High-level cooperative scheduler orchestrating simulation tasks
 *         (entity lifecycle, IO polling, maintenance) within the Director
 *         process main loop.
 *
 *  Responsibilities
 *  ----------------
 *  - Accepts enqueued tasks (closures / function objects) via task_queue.h.
 *  - Orders execution (round-robin / priority buckets TBD) each tick.
 *  - Integrates timing (delayed / periodic tasks) using a wheel or min-heap
 *    abstraction (future work; currently immediate tasks only if minimal).
 *  - Exposes hooks for metrics emission per tick and backlog depth.
 *
 *  Design Sketch
 *  -------------
 *  The scheduler decouples producers (IPC handlers, timers, control bridge)
 *  from execution to bound latency spikes and provide observability into
 *  pending work. Tasks are stored in a bounded MPSC queue (atomic_queue.h)
 *  and drained in batches to amortize synchronization overhead.
 *
 *  Concurrency Model
 *  -----------------
 *  Single consumer (Director main thread) drains the queue; multiple
 *  producers may push concurrently (IPC threads, control bridge). Memory
 *  ordering relies on atomic_queue.h publish/consume semantics.
 *
 *  Error Handling
 *  --------------
 *  Enqueue operations may fail (queue full) and should surface backpressure
 *  to callers (e.g., drop low-priority telemetry tasks). Scheduler tick
 *  itself aims to run to completion; failures inside tasks must be isolated.
 *
 *  Future Extensions
 *  -----------------
 *  - Priority tiers (latency-sensitive vs background).
 *  - Time wheel for delayed tasks.
 *  - Work stealing across workers if Director becomes overloaded.
